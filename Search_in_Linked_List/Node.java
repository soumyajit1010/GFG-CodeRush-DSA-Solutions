    Problem:
    Given a linked list of n nodes and a key, 
    check if the key is present in the linked list.

    Example:
    Input:
        n = 4, key = 3
        Linked List: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
    Output:
        true
    Explanation:
        3 is present in the linked list, so return true.

    Constraints:
        1 <= n <= 10^5
        1 <= key <= 10^5

    Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
    Expected Space Complexity: O(1)

                return true; // Key found
            }
            current = current.next;
        }
        return false; // Key not found
    }

/*
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Traverse the linked list once, checking each node.

    Space Complexity: O(1)
    - No extra space is used apart from a pointer.
