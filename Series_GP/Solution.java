Series GP
Difficulty: Easy
Given three integers a, r, and n, where:
- a is the first term of a geometric progression (GP),
- r is the common ratio,
- n is the term number to find.

Return the nth term of the GP modulo 1000000007 (1e9 + 7).

Examples:

Input: a = 2, r = 2, n = 4
Output: 16
Explanation: The GP series is 2, 4, 8, 16,... → 4th term is 16.

Input: a = 4, r = 3, n = 3
Output: 36
Explanation: The GP series is 4, 12, 36,... → 3rd term is 36.
