Divide Array
Difficulty: Easy
Accuracy: 29.27%

Problem:
----------
You are given an array A of N elements.
- You must remove exactly N/2 elements from A and put them into another array B (initially empty).
- After this, you can rearrange the elements of A and B in any order.

The "difference" between the two arrays is defined as:
    diff = |sum(A) - sum(B)|

You need to find:
    1. The **minimum** possible value of diff.
    2. The **maximum** possible value of diff.

Input:
------
T               -> number of test cases
N               -> size of array
A[1..N]         -> array elements

Output:
-------
For each test case, output:
    min_diff max_diff

Constraints:
------------
1 <= T <= 10^3
1 <= N <= 10^5
-10^9 <= A[i] <= 10^9
Sum of N across test cases <= 10^5

Example:
--------
Input:
2
6
1 2 -3 -4 0 7
4
-10 -20 -30 -40

Output:
7 17
20 40

Explanation (Test 1):
----------------------
Array sorted: [-4, -3, 0, 1, 2, 7]

For max_diff:
  Put smallest N/2 in B and largest N/2 in A:
    A = [0, 1, 2], B = [-4, -3, 7] (after rearranging for diff)
    => max_diff = sum(largest half) - sum(smallest half) = 10 - (-7) = 17

For min_diff:
  Put elements so that sums are as close as possible.
  Best is smallest N/4 + largest N/4 in each array — here it's:
    A = [-4, 7, 0], B = [-3, 1, 2]
    => min_diff = |3 - 0| = 3, but the example gets 7 by optimal distribution.

Approach:
---------
1. Sort the array.
2. For max_diff:
   - Take largest N/2 in one array, smallest N/2 in the other.
   - max_diff = |sum(largest N/2) - sum(smallest N/2)|

3. For min_diff:
   - Sort array.
   - Pair smallest with largest to balance sums between A and B.
   - Place first N/2 smallest in A, rest in B (or vice versa) but try to minimize sum difference.
   - In sorted order, min_diff = |sum(last N/2) - sum(first N/2)|.

Time Complexity:
----------------
- Sorting: O(N log N)
- Summation: O(N)
Total: O(N log N) per test case

Space Complexity:
-----------------
O(1) extra (excluding input storage)
